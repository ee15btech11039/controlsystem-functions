run
bal.m>>testbalred.sci>>testbalred.m    //to generate graphs



result: in case of stable system the results of scilab balred function is 
matching totally with scilab's balred function,in case of unstable system there 
is slight differences in some cases,as can be seen from the graph(figure3)
